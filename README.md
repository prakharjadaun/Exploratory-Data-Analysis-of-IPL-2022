# **IPL-Statistics-2022**

We have performed web scrapping on the data of IPL 2022. We have retrieved data such as:

1. Points Table
2. Orange Cap Table
3. Purple Cap Table
4. Best Average
5. Best Economy
6. Most Sixes
7. Most Fours
8. Most Fifties

## **Web Scrapping**

Inside the Web Scrapping folder there are two files namely :

- WebScrap.ipynb
- WebScrap2.ipynb

In both these files, we have retrieved the data dynamically. Everyday after the game we just have to run both the jupyter notebooks and the updated data for the data will be stored in csv files.

## **Analysis**

The 'Main' folder contains the analysis of the data in the two files:

- Analysis.ipynb
- Analysis2.ipnyb

## **Datasets**
